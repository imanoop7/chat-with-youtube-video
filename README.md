# Chat with YouTube Video

Welcome to the `chat-with-youtube-video` repository! This project focuses on creating a chatbot that can interact with YouTube videos using Gradio, OpenAI's GPT-3, and OpenAI Whisper. The main components of this project include a Jupyter notebook (`youtube_chatbot.ipynb`) and a Python script (`youtube_chatbot.py`) for building and running the chatbot.

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to build a chatbot that can interact with YouTube videos. The chatbot uses OpenAI Whisper to transcribe the video content, and OpenAI GPT-3 to provide relevant information or answer questions about the video. Gradio is used to create an interactive interface for the chatbot.

## Requirements

To run the chatbot and the scripts, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- OpenAI GPT-3 API
- OpenAI Whisper API
- Gradio
- YouTube Data API

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required packages:

## Usage
### Jupyter Notebook
Open the Jupyter notebook to explore and develop the chatbot model:
1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
2. Open youtube_chatbot.ipynb in your browser.
3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to configure the YouTube Data 
   API, load the model, and test the chatbot.

## Python Script
To run the chatbot using the Python script:

1. Configure your API keys and settings in the script.
2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python youtube_chatbot.py

This will start the chatbot with a Gradio interface, allowing you to interact with the chatbot in your web browser.
